\title{Provides high level summary of model results.}
\usage{
Summary(model, n = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The output of an LTNLDA model trained on a training set.}

\item{n}{We find the n most prevalent ASVs in each subcommunity, with proportions.}
}
\value{
A list with two entries.  Abundance is a vector of the average subcommunity prevalence in all samples in decreasing order. Top_ASVs is a list such tha the kth entry is the the top n ASVs characterizing the kth subcommunity (in decreasing order of average subcommunity prevalence) as well the corresponding ASV prevalencies.
}
\description{
This function takes the output of an LTNLDA function as an input, and finds the average subcommunity abundance in decreasing order, as well as the top n ASVs characterizing each subcommunity.  More detailed information in "LTN-LDA" vignette.
